# Covid-Detection-using-X-ray-images
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for reliable and efficient diagnostic tools to detect the virus. One promising approach is to use X-ray images of the lungs, which can show characteristic patterns associated with the disease. Deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence that can automatically learn to recognize complex patterns in data, has shown promising results for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images.

In this project, we aim to use deep learning techniques to develop a model for COVID-19 detection from X-ray images. We will collect a dataset of X-ray images from patients with and without COVID-19, and train a deep learning model to recognize the patterns associated with the disease. The model will be validated on a separate test set, and its performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for COVID-19 detection using X-ray images, which could help healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate diagnoses, particularly in areas with limited access to other diagnostic tools such as PCR tests.
